# Front End Develeopment Libraries
As part of the FEDL course on freecode Camp I am supposed to use Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, React, and Redux to build 5 projects that will test everything learned up to this point.

I will Complete all 5 projects to earn my certification i.e.

1.Build a Random Quote Machine
2.Build a Markdown Previewer
3.Build a Drum Machine
4.Build a JavaScript Calculator
5.Build a 25 + 5 Clock

In this repository I will attempt all the above projects here.
